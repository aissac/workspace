## Conversation Summary

user: System: [2026-02-11 14:23:06 EST] Exec failed (good-pra, signal SIGKILL)

Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
assistant: HEARTBEAT_OK

**System Health (14:23 EST):** Memory 66% • Disk 49% • Load 1.03 • Ollama ✓ • Docker ✓ • All services nominal. (Note: SIGKILL on `good-prairie` was pip install process I terminated earlier — not a system issue.)
user: A scheduled reminder has been triggered. The reminder message is shown in the system messages above. Please relay this reminder to the user in a helpful and friendly way.
assistant: **⏰ Reminder Triggered**

Hey! A scheduled reminder just fired. Based on recent activity, this might be related to one of these:

- **Package updates** — 25 packages available (from earlier check)
- **Search API setup** — Follow-up on replacing Brave with OpenRouter/DuckDuckGo
- **Daily security audit** — Next one runs tonight at 2:00 AM

What's this reminder for? Happy to help wrap it up!
user: [Wed 2026-02-11 14:39 EST] we shall use web fetch and proactive browser control . perplexity sonar inst free in openrouter now
[message_id: c498fb93-3c6d-4409-8c3f-1ee9bbb20bd0]
assistant: Done. Let me clean up the config and document the new approach.   
assistant: ---

## ✅ **Search Strategy Updated — Zero API Keys**

### Changes Made:

| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Removed `web_search` config from `openclaw.json` | ✅ Disabled (was Perplexity/OpenRouter) |
| Kept `web_fetch` enabled | ✅ Active, no API key needed |
| Updated `MEMORY.md` | ✅ Documented API-free approach |
| Created `SEARCH_STRATEGY.md` | ✅ New reference guide |
| Deleted temp files | ✅ Removed old configs/scripts |

---

## **New Search Workflow**

### **Primary: `web_fetch`**

Fast, free, direct — use when you know the source:

```javascript
web_fetch({ url: "https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html" })
web_fetch({ url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu" })
```

### **Secondary: `browser`**

For discovery and dynamic sites:

```javascript
browser.open({ url: "https://search.sapti.me/?q=your+query" })
browser.snapshot()  // See results, click, interact
```

---

## **Why This Works**

- **No API keys** — Never worry about rate limits or costs
- **No external dependencies** — Just HTTP requests and browser control
- **More reliable** — No service downtime from API providers
- **More targeted** — Fetch exactly what you need, not search results

---

The `web_search` tool is now disabled. Any previous `web_search` calls will fail gracefully — just switch to `web_fetch` with a specific URL or use `browser` for discovery.

**Master Agent web access: Fully autonomous, zero cost.**

assistant: **📌 Scheduled Reminder**

Hey! A scheduled reminder just triggered. Based on our recent setup work, this could be:

- **Security audit progress** — First automated audit runs tonight at 2 AM
- **Package updates** — Those 25 upgradable packages still waiting
- **Something you scheduled** earlier that I should follow up on

What's this reminder for? I'm ready to help however you need!
user: [Wed 2026-02-11 15:05 EST] have you configured the cron jobs properly?... remember running cron jobs in large context sessions is not recomended for token efficiency
[message_id: 9285c8fd-9424-4313-bb73-ef9850153e3a]
assistant: Good catch. Let me audit and optimize the cron architecture:

## Current State

| Job | Schedule | Session | Status |
|-----|----------|---------|--------|
| **system-heartbeat** | Every 30 min | `main` | ⚠️ Lightweight but adds tokens |
| **security-audit** | Daily 2:00 AM | `isolated` | ✅ Correct - runs in sub-agent |
| **update-status** | Weekly Fri 3 AM | `main` | ⚠️ Should be isolated |

**Issues:**
- `main` session jobs add output to my context window over time
- `systemEvent` in main = my context grows
- `agentTurn` in isolated = fresh context, result streamed back

Let me fix this:  
assistant: Now for the heartbeat — this is the critical one (runs every 30 min). Let me rearchitect it for zero main-session token impact:    
assistant: ---

## ✅ **Cron Jobs Reconfigured — Token Efficiency Optimized**

### Before (Token Bloating)
| Job | Session | Problem |
|-----|---------|---------|
| **system-heartbeat** | `main` | Every 30 min adds shell output to my context |
| **update-status** | `main` | Weekly adds command results to my context |
| **security-audit** | `isolated` | ✅ Already correct |

### After (Zero Context Impact)
| Job | Session | Output |
|-----|---------|--------|
| **system-heartbeat-file** | `isolated` | Logs to `memory/heartbeat-YYYY-MM-DD.log` only |
| **security-audit** | `isolated` | Logs to file, announces only if critical |
| **update-status** | `isolated` | Reports summary, doesn't pollute context |

---

## **Architectural Change**

**Before:** Cron jobs dumped output into `main` session → My context grew with every heartbeat  
**After:** All jobs spawn as **isolated sub-agents** → Fresh context each time, results logged to files

---

## **Result**

✅ **100% of cron jobs now run in isolated sessions**  
✅ **My main context never grows from scheduled tasks**  
✅ **Sub-agents handle the work → I remain the orchestrator**  
✅ **Heartbeat logs go to files, not chat spam**

Old `system-heartbeat` disabled. New `system-heartbeat-file` active.

**Token efficiency: Achieved.**
